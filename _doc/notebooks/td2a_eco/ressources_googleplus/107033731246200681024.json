The \u201clabor share\u201d of national income \u2014 the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers\u2019 pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere \u2014 has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy.This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don\u2019t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing.Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people.Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 \u2014 and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century.\"\u201cThe management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,\u201d said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. \u201cBut in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.\u201d\ufeff",

At my hotel, they listed all the flights, so it would be easy to see. I was traveling on the first flight out on a Saturday morning, and there may be other times that are much more crowded. \u00a0\ufeff",

With this would come a fundamental change: from procuring or buying a set solution to building California\u2019s ability to understand, direct, and control the critical technology needed for government to do its job well....\"But why would a Child Welfare System in particular be a good choice for this new approach? Child welfare services personnel in California investigate nearly half a million reports of severe maltreatment and life-threatening neglect to children a year. Of those half a million, around 80,000 reports are confirmed annually, 30,000 children must be removed from their homes, and at any time almost 100,000 children are living in foster care for their protection or live with their parents under close county protective supervision. The Child Welfare System was the perfect choice for a new approach because it\u2019s too important to fail.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "\"Surely Democrats and Republicans could agree to cut billions from a failed program like this!\" you think. What their failure to do so says something about politics, but I think it also speaks to the failed regulatory model that we use to manage programs like this. \u00a0From the article: \u00a0\"Consider the Education Management Corporation, which runs 110 schools in the United States for chefs, artists and other trades. It has been investigated or sued in recent years by prosecutors in at least 12 states. The Justice Department has accused the company of illegally using incentives to pay its recruiters. And last year, investors filed a class-action lawsuit, contending that the company engaged in deceptive enrollment practices and manipulated federal student loan and grant programs.\u00a0Education Management nonetheless received more than $1.25 billion in federal money over the last school year....\"The continuing flow of money illustrates the quandary facing federal education officials. On one hand, they have moved forcefully to try to protect taxpayer funds and prevent students from falling deeply into debt without anything to show for it. On the other, they must avoid running roughshod over private for-profit schools that have not been found guilty of wrongdoing. Agency officials point out that they cannot withhold money based on accusations, but must have proof of misconduct.\"The fundamental notion that you can only regulate by punishing wrongdoing is at the heart of the failure. Good regulatory systems are management systems, that keep a system operating smoothly.A plane's autopilot does not kick in after the plane has crashed. It is designed to keep it from crashing. Credit card fraud detection software doesn't wait till you've gone bankrupt from fraudulent charges to intervene and stop further transactions. Google search quality doesn't reserve space in the top spots for spammers lest it hurt their business!These practical and commercial regulatory regimes should be a model for how we think about government regulation as well.I've written about this topic at greater length in my article Open Data and Algorithmic Regulation: \u00a0http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/\ufeff",

   "content": "How fragile life is, even for the best of us. We heard this morning that our friend Jake Brewer was killed yesterday in a bike accident.\u00a0I try to take comfort in poetry. I have always loved Wallace Stevens' thoughts in Esthetique du Mal in moments like this:\"He breathes a summer sleep,In which his wound is good because life was.No part of him was ever part of death.\"And yes, there is somehow a deep continuity, in which we all one way or another come to that moment of our undoing, and our end is just one more part of a good life. None of us know when it will be. So we have to make the most of each moment - and that's what Jake did, throwing himself into life, fully.But it's still a tragedy. Edna St Vincent Millay captured that tragedy perfectly in Dirge without Music:\"I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. CrownedWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,A formula, a phrase remains,\u2014but the best is lost.The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\u2014They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curledIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.Down, down, down into the darkness of the graveGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\"\ufeff",

What's the Future of Work? \u00a0It's a look at robots, AI, and the on-demand economy, and what they tell us about the future of work, the shape of corporations, and the issues we should be grappling with now if we want these profound changes to come out for the best.My co-host for the event is Steven Levy of Medium. While the speaker list is still preliminary, it tells the story of what we're going after. Explore the speaker pages - I've loaded them with quotes from the speakers, which will help you understand in advance where they are coming from. Over the next few weeks and months, we'll be curating an online conversation, with lots of great reading and viewing, to engage with these ideas, whether or not you are coming to the event.\ufeff",

(Clicking on the field opens a map. \u00a0Whoopee!\u00a0Note to developers: once you have basic features working, don't break them when you add new, \"cool\" features.This interface is a huge step backwards. \u00a0Something that used to be accomplished with one click now takes three or four.\u00a0And exiting from a single card is also incredibly awkward!\ufeff",

Indeed, microbes in and on the body outnumber human cells about 10 to one.\u201cYou are a minority party in the democracy of the body,\u201d Dr. Mason said.\"The body\u2019s collection of microbes, called the microbiome, influences health in ways that researchers are only beginning to understand. They may be key to proper digestion, vitamin synthesis and brain function, new research suggests. Changes among the millions of microbes living in the human stomach also may promote obesity, trigger ulcers or affect how well a flu vaccine works.\"The article describes a research project to explore signs of this microbiome expressed on surfaces throughout the NYC subways.My two favorite quotes:\u201cA city is like an organism,\u201d said IBM Corp. computational biologist Robert Prill, who is among those at the company investigating ways to better collect and analyze these immense new public-health genome databases. \u201cIt has a circulating system consisting of the movement of people.\u201dand\u201cWe know next to nothing about the ecology of urban environments,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Jonathan Eisen at the University of California at Davis. \u201cHow will we know if there is something abnormal if we don\u2019t know what normal is?\u201d\ufeff",

It's a fascinating article about CBW, a tiny bank in Kansas, that has become a laboratory for financial innovation with a focus on better user experience.\"The creation of the new bank, and the maintenance of the old one, are the work of a couple who were born in India and ended up in Kansas after living in Silicon Valley and passing through jobs at Google and Lehman Brothers....\"Their work is an unusual experiment: a new kind of mom-and-pop business trying to reshape a highly regulated and innovation-resistant industry. The new services that CBW is providing, like instant payments to any bank in the United States, direct remittance transfers abroad and specialized debit cards, might seem as if they should be painless upgrades in an age of high-frequency trading and interplanetary space missions. But with most banks, it still takes longer to send money to another country or even to another state than it does to travel the same distance.\"I was particularly struck by this paragraph, which reminded me of the fundamental game plan that we practice on government with the Code for America Fellowship:\"As he and his wife had hoped, buying an established institution allowed them to examine how money transfers and payment technology worked in a traditional bank \u2014 something that was hard to see in detail from the outside \u2014 and to consider how to make changes.\"His first discovery was that nearly all banks rely on a few big, and not terribly agile, outside vendors to provide all the software that makes bank computer systems work. Mr. Ramamurthi found a small technology provider that would be more flexible and allow him to begin tweaking the software....\"Get inside, figure out how it works now. Then start to iterate towards change, making the institution more flexible, and able to meet real user needs.\ufeff",

I shared Blaise Pascal's famous line, \"I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter\" and told the story I'd heard attributed to\u00a0Woodrow Wilson. \u00a0When asked how long it took him to prepare for a five minute speech, he said \"About two weeks.\" \u00a0Astonished listener: \"Well, then, how long does it take you to prepare for an hour-long speech?\" Wilson: \u00a0\"Oh, I could do that right now.\"But I think she topped me with her anecdote, apparently from a priest who said it about his technique for writing sermons.\ufeff",

If it were consistent with the Obama open data guidance, that RFP would require an API so that independent companies could provide alternate interfaces, just like travel sites provide booking interfaces for air travel, hotels, and more.\u00a0Unfortunately, as drafted, the RFP allows the winning contractor to determine whether an API is feasible \u2014 meaning the company that benefits most from keeping all the reservations to itself \u00a0has the authority to do so. And the draft even removes data that is currently accessible \u2014 availability data \u2014 from public sharing. So, it\u2019s a huge step backward, and completely out of step with the administration\u2019s open data policy.The founder of Hipcamp, Alyssa Ravasio, has written up some thoughts on how this RFP could be improved that I want to share with you. And after reading them, I\u2019m hoping you will be moved to send comments asking the Department of the Interior to reconsider their RFP.Comments on this draft are accepted via email to jasonmking@fs.fed.us through Wednesday October 22. Please send your comments.\ufeff",

   "content": "Can We Use Data to Make Better Regulations?Evgeny Morozov either misunderstands or misrepresents the key point of my piece on Algorithmic Regulation. \u00a0In his recent New Yorker article about big data and regulation, he summarizes my view as \"collect as much relevant data from as many sources as possible, analyze them in real time, and make an optimal decision based on the current circumstances rather than on some idealized projection.\"In fact, my article is about building regulations that do a better job of achieving their \u00a0long term idealized outcome! \u00a0Morozov has \u00a0got it precisely backwards.Here's what I actually said on the subject. \u00a0The article opens:\"Regulation is the bugaboo of today\u2019s politics. We have too much of it in most areas, we have too little of it in others, but mostly, we just have the wrong kind, a mountain of paper rules, inefficient processes, and little ability to adjust the rules or the processes when we discover the inevitable unintended results.\"Consider, for a moment, regulation in a broader context. Your car\u2019s electronics regulate the fuel-air mix in the engine to find an optimal balance of fuel efficiency and minimal emissions. An airplane\u2019s autopilot regulates the countless factors required to keep that plane aloft and heading in the right direction. Credit card companies monitor and regulate charges to detect fraud and keep you under your credit limit. Doctors regulate the dosage of the medicine they give us, sometimes loosely, sometimes with exquisite care, as with the chemotherapy required to kill cancer cells while keeping normal cells alive, or with the anesthesia that keeps us unconscious during surgery while keeping vital processes going. ISPs and corporate mail systems regulate the mail that reaches us, filtering out spam and malware to the best of their ability. Search engines regulate the results and advertisements they serve up to us, doing their best to give us more of what we want to see.\"What do all these forms of regulation have in common?\"A deep understanding of the desired outcome\"Real-time measurement to determine if that outcome is being achieved\"Algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that make adjustments based on new data\"Periodic, deeper analysis of whether the algorithms themselves are correct and performing as expected.\"There are a few cases\u2014all too few\u2014in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies regulate using processes similar to those outlined above. Probably the best example is the way that central banks regulate the money supply in an attempt to manage interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. Surprisingly, while individual groups might prefer the US Federal Reserve to tighten or loosen the money supply at a different time or rate than they do, most accept the need for this kind of regulation.\"Why is this?\"The desired outcomes are clear\"There is regular measurement and reporting as to whether those outcomes are being achieved, based on data that is made public to everyone\"Adjustments are made when the desired outcomes are not being achieved\"Contrast this with the normal regulatory model, which focuses on the rules rather than the outcomes. How often have we faced rules that simply no longer make sense? How often do we see evidence that the rules are actually achieving the desired outcome?\"(http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/).\ufeff",

But so is the idea of a \"universal remote.\" So what will the platform be for interoperability in the smart home, smart car, and the smart body network? \u00a0We had a spirited debate on the O'Reilly Radar backchannel, which +Jon Bruner\u00a0and +Jenn Webb\u00a0 turned into a blog post, in which we handicap the various players.There was a lot of support for Apple as the winner; I argued for Google/Android.\u00a0I am a huge fan of Google Now. It seems to me to be the most interesting thing happening in Silicon Valley today. It is getting smarter by leaps and bounds, and is pointing us towards a whole new way of interacting with computers. \u00a0The combination of Google Now voice control with a smart watch running Google Wear has been truly transformative for the way I interact with applications and devices.What I'm waiting for is a better \"user programming model.\" \u00a0Google Now or Siri plus IFTTT. \u00a0Speech brings us back to the command line, and the Unix Shell was the most powerful command line I've used. I loved how it seduced people into programming. \u00a0Anything could be a command, and you could combine them into new \"scripts\" (sentences if you will), that then could become first class verbs of their own. \u00a0It is the ideal model for the speech system of the future: \u00a0a constrained vocabulary to begin with, but ultimate customizability. Just like spoken and written language itself.\u00a0Of course, I didn't say all that in the post below. But it's the thinking behind my handicapping Google way ahead of Apple in this horse race.\ufeff",

Jascha Franklin Hodge in Boston, Teresa Reno Webber in Louisville, Beth Niblock in Detroit, and Rick Cole,  Peter Marx, and Abhi Nemani in LA all come to mind. There are so many people in government who are hungry for new ways of doing things. They went into public service to make a difference, and they want help from private sector partners who are working with 21st century technology and business models.The outside game has largely consisted of nonprofits like Code for America and Datakind, but now increasingly we are seeing commercial companies who are bringing new ways of thinking to government projects.

   "content": "Why Common Core is Like Healthcare.govDraw a bold line between this piece on the failure of the Common Core initiative to improve math education and the failure of healthcare.gov (even though the Common Core has nothing to do with IT): \"The inadequate implementation can make math reforms seem like the most absurd form of policy change.\"This is the sermon that +Mike Bracken\u00a0and +Jennifer Pahlka\u00a0have been preaching. \u00a0As Mike puts it, \"We don't have a policy crisis. We have a delivery crisis!\" \u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them.In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of healthcare.gov in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\u201d (See http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj)In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\u00a0\"The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....\"\"With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.\"By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \u00a0\"In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \u201clesson study,\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\u2019s teachers.\"This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.\ufeff",

   "content": "\u00a0+Maria Konnikova's NY Times article about the role of time and attention scarcity in the cycle of poverty was arresting and important. It really echoed some of the issues that we've seen at +Code for America\u00a0- there's a section at the end of the article that is going to be quoted often by people involved in the business of improving government services:\"If poverty is about time and mental bandwidth as well as money, how does this change how we combat its effects? 'When we think about programs for the poor, we don\u2019t ever think, hey, let\u2019s give them programs that don\u2019t use a lot of bandwidth,' says Mr. Mullainathan. Instead, we fault people for failing to sign up for programs that are ostensibly available, even though we don\u2019t factor in the time and cognitive capacity they need to get past even the first step.\u201c'If I give people a very complicated form, it\u2019s a big demand on cognitive capacity,' Mr. Shafir says. 'Take something like the Fafsa' \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 'Why is pickup for the low-income families less than 30 percent? People are already overwhelmed, and you go and give them an incredibly complicated form.'\"To him, the obvious conclusion is to radically change our thinking. 'Just like you wouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 to fill out a form, you shouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 in cognitive complexity,' he says. One study found that if you offer help with filling out the Fafsa form, pickup goes up significantly.\"It starts with empathyJake Solomon has another take on the issue, which he explains so well in his post People, Not Data\u00a0https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 about the work he and the other Code for America fellows in San Francisco did last year to simplify the compliance for Food Stamp recipients. \u00a0What I love about Maria's article, though, is that it gives another way of thinking about why complex government forms are even worse than they appear, especially when it comes to providing services to people least able to deal with them.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"We don't need new policies. We need better implementation.\"Last night, I hosted Oakland City Councilor and mayoral candidate Libby Schaaf at a house party to introduce her to my neighbors. In response to a question about what to do about one of Oakland's many problems, she said \"We don't need new policies. \u00a0We need better implementation.\" \u00a0And in response to a question about disengaged city employees, she talked about the ones who really want to make a difference, and are just waiting to be activated.That resonated so strongly with me, because just the night before, I'd been at a talk by\u00a0+Mikey Dickerson\u00a0about the healthcare.gov rescue effort, which sounded almost exactly the same notes. \u00a0It's easy to imagine heroic Silicon Valley coders riding to the rescue, but Mikey pointed out that they wrote very little code. \u00a0Much of the rescue work was done by the same people who built the broken site. \u00a0What the Silicon Valley team provided was clear management focus from people who knew what they were doing. They were able to debug all the bad process and broken communications between the various contractors who'd built the site, figure out what they needed from each of them, and then encourage and bring out the best in those people. They also had the guts and the force of will to get the recalcitrants on board. \u00a0(I wrote more about this at\u00a0http://bit.ly/healthcare_rescue )So much of the work we do at Code for America is drawn from the same playbook (though we usually don't have the kind of mandate that the \"Code Red\" healthcare.gov rescue team did!) \u00a0It's about debugging a process, making small tech interventions, but even more about helping \"the system\" to work better by understanding needs and figuring out why they aren't being met. \u00a0(See for example Jake Solomon's brilliant post about his work in San Francisco last year:\u00a0https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8)We have a constant parade of politicians who tell us what we want to hear: that they have a new policy idea, and that if we follow their advice, everything will be great. \u00a0This kind of \"magic bullet\" thinking is what gets us the same dismal results, over and over. \u00a0To be sure, there are times when we do need new policies, and I'm sure Libby has her share of policy ideas too. \u00a0But getting away from policy and digging into implementation is so important! So much of the problem isn't what we set out to do, it's how we do it. \u00a0I love hearing someone speak truth about that.P.S.\u00a0As a city councilor, Libby is in a non-executive role. \u00a0If she is in charge of actual implementation, I'm super-excited to see what she can do. \u00a0If you're an Oakland city resident, I hope you turn out and vote for her in November. \u00a0If you'd like to learn more, I'm co-hosting another, bigger event for Libby at the new (still under construction) BlueSprout Maker space in Oakland next Sunday. \u00a0Sign up to attend here:http://www.eventbrite.com/e/libbyraiser-tickets-11878702519\ufeff",

   "content": "Great talk by Maciej Ceglowski. \u00a0Funny, smart, and with an important message. \u00a0Just like Maciej all around. \u00a0It is too long since I've spent time with him!I loved his thoughts on regulation, quoted below. \u00a0I don't agree with his initial statement that it should be \"illegal to collect\" certain kinds of data but do agree that it should be \"illegal to permanently store\" it. I think that's what he thinks too, if you read on beyond that first line.REGULATEIt should be illegal to collect and permanently store most kinds of behavioral data.In the United States, they warn us the world will end if someone tries to regulate the Internet. But the net itself was born of a fairly good regulatory framework that made sure de facto net neutrality existed for decades, paid for basic research into protocols and software, cleared the way for business use of the internet, and encouraged the growth of the commercial web.It's good regulation, not lack of regulation, that kept the web healthy. Here's one idea for where to begin:1. Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing\u2014your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you're using.It's very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn't limit people's ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save.2. Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don't really care, as long as it's not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business.3. Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people's data non-transferable without their consent. 4. Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it's not evenly enforced.This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you're not concerned about protecting it. But it's a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it.5. Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups. 6. Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I'll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let's create a mechanism that allow this.7. Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today's targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You're supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ's sake!8. Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn't matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.\ufeff",

It\u2019s outrageous, we\u2019re told, that all kids on the field may get a thanks-for-playing token, in contrast to the good old days, when recognition was reserved for the conquering heroes.\"Children are said to be indulged and overcelebrated, spared from having to confront the full impact of their inadequacy. There are ringing declarations about the benefits of frustration and the need for grit.\"These themes are sounded with numbing regularity, yet those who sound them often adopt a self-congratulatory tone, as if it took extraordinary gumption to say pretty much what everyone else is saying. Indeed, this fundamentally conservative stance on children and parenting has become common even for people who are liberal on other issues.\"While I most certainly agree with the premise of the article, that unconditional love is best for kids, and that, as Cohn says:\"Over the last decade or so, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, and their colleagues in the United States and Belgium, have conducted a series of experiments whose consistent finding is that when children feel their parents\u2019 affection varies depending on the extent to which they are well behaved, self-controlled or impressive at school or sports, this promotes \u201cthe development of a fragile, contingent and unstable sense of self.\u201d'and\"Kids shouldn\u2019t be spared struggle and sacrifice, regardless of the effects. The second value is scarcity: the belief that excellence, by definition, is something that not everyone can attain. No matter how well a group of students performs, only a few should get A\u2019s. Otherwise we\u2019re sanctioning \u201cgrade inflation\u201d and mediocrity. To have high standards, there must always be losers.\"But it\u2019s the third conviction that really ties everything together: an endorsement of conditionality. Children ought never to receive something desirable \u2014 a sum of money, a trophy, a commendation \u2014 unless they\u2019ve done enough to merit it. They shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to feel good about themselves without being able to point to tangible accomplishments. In this view, we have a moral obligation to reward the deserving and, equally important, make sure the undeserving go conspicuously unrewarded.\"There is also something odd in the framing of the article, which comes across as a defense of all the faux rewards that are given in the name of self-esteem, when in fact, I think Cohn's whole career and his previous books (e.g. the classic Punished by Rewards) emphasizes the downside of what is now called \"gamification\" and instead argues for intrinsic motivation.So it is important not to read this piece too quickly, but instead to think about what (I think) he is really saying:* Focus on giving your kids unconditional love, unblemished by either punishment or rewards* But don't be afraid of giving them encouragement* And don't buy into the idea that to be self-motivated, they need to get \"tough love.\"I know Cohn's thought is interesting and complex, and without knowing his previous work, I could easily see people being confused by what he was trying to say here, thinking that it is a defense of \"helicopter parents.\" \u00a0Which I don't think it is...\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "How to Raise Moral ChildrenI thought this article on child-raising had a lot of good ideas in it. \u00a0There was stuff that was new to me, and stuff that was old, but the old stuff was worth reviewing, and the new research quite enlightening.Do read the article even if you don't have children.\u00a0The principles it outlines apply to our lives as adults as well, to leadership in the workplace and in the world. \u00a0And while I've reproduced many of the best bits below, it's well worth going to the article itself, because it is heavily linked to the original research.What matters most is not achievement but caringThe article opened with the familiar advice that\u00a0\"when parents praise effort rather than ability, children develop a stronger work ethic and become more motivated.\" \u00a0But it went from there in a surprising direction:\"When people in 50 countries were asked to report their guiding principles in life, the value that mattered most was not achievement, but caring.\"Contrary to popular advice, praise of character is more effective than praise of behavior\"Many parents believe it\u2019s important to compliment the behavior, not the child \u2014 that way, the child learns to repeat the behavior. Indeed, I know one couple who are careful to say, 'That was such a helpful thing to do,' instead of, 'You\u2019re a helpful person.'\"But that's not what the research shows:\"...A couple of weeks later, when faced with more opportunities to give and share, the children were much more generous after their character had been praised than after their actions had been. Praising their character helped them internalize it as part of their identities. The children learned who they were from observing their own actions: I am a helpful person. This dovetails with new research led by the psychologist Christopher J. Bryan, who finds that for moral behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3- to 6-year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them 'to help,' it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to 'be a helper.' Cheating was cut in half when instead of, 'Please don\u2019t cheat,' participants were told, 'Please don\u2019t be a cheater.' When our actions become a reflection of our character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices. Over time it can become part of us.\"I think this is an important insight. \u00a0Internalizing our experiences and making them part of our identity is a key element of growing up.\u00a0Note: \u00a0\"by the time children turned 10, the differences between praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective. Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity.\"I will note that the advice for dealing with bad behavior (as opposed to good behavior) is just the opposite: \u00a0to emphasize the behavior, and not the character. \u00a0You don't want a kid to internalize the idea that he or she is a bad person! \u00a0That was the next key point, the distinction between guilt and shame.\"If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave.\"This is a fascinating distinction: \u00a0\"When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions are interchangeable, research led by the psychologist June Price Tangney reveals that they have very different causes and consequences.\"Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it right.\"...\"The most effective response to bad behavior is to express disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor Eisenberg and David R. Shaffer, parents raise caring children by expressing disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of empathy and responsibility for others, and a sense of moral identity, which are conducive to becoming a helpful person. The beauty of expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for improvement: 'You\u2019re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I know you can do better.'\"Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\"In a classic experiment, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140 elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game, which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty. They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or neither. The adult\u2019s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit. The words didn\u2019t make much difference \u2014 children gave fewer tokens after observing the adult\u2019s selfish actions, regardless of whether the adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was preached or not \u2014 they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm. Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\"So true. \u00a0As I said above, all of this applies to adults too.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "Journalism vs. Punditry: NPR's Kelly McEvers on Why Reporting MattersThere was a great segment on KQED Forum the other day with NPR correspondent Kelly McEvers. \u00a0Throughout the segment, she talked about the power of reporting. \u00a0She tells the story of when she was called to Bahrain for a government press conference about how all the protests were settled, and heard instead of how there was brutal crackdown going on in a nearby town that very day, rushed to the scene, and were able to report the substance rather than the government-controlled show. \u00a0But perhaps the best moment comes at the end of the interview, reproduced below. \u00a0(It starts about about minute 47:48 in the audio file.)Caller: \u00a0I was in Syria too, and it really bothers me that people like you that have such a rare and important experience, that you don't give your own opinion. \u00a0For instance why President Obama... or criticize him for not getting rid of Assad like he got rid of Quaddafi. \u00a0And I know your editors and people try to control it and won't let you but I think you could do that now and maybe you could just give me your comments. \u00a0It must be very frustrating that you don't give your opinion on what should be done. \u00a0You just report a story.McEvers: \u00a0Well, guess what? \u00a0The people's opinions are much more valuable than my opinion. \u00a0Like I was just a conduit. \u00a0I'll never forget this one woman. \u00a0I was at a funeral in a village in rebel-controlled Syria and it was the first guy to die in this village. And I was on the women's side, with the mourning, and this woman looked at me and she \"Where is America? Where is Obama? \u00a0What? Syrian children aren't as good as Libyan children?\" \u00a0She said \"You know something? We're not going to forget this. We're not going to forget that you forgot about us.\" And all I had to do was report that line. I'm sorry but I feel like that's 10,000 times more powerful than me getting up like some TV pundit and spouting my opinion. That's who I am. I'm a journalist. That's my job.\"How right she is. \u00a0What you choose to report is, of course, an expression of your opinion. \u00a0But the power of doing it directly, with other people's voices, is profound. Being a channel for otherwise unheard voices that matter can be so much more effective than explicit editorializing.via +Jennifer Pahlka\u00a0\ufeff",

Then love what you will.\" \u00a0Learning to love doing what you have to do is a wonderful way to develop good life habits around chores. \u00a0(It could easily guide you wrong in other areas, but is a useful mental touchstone.)\ufeff",

   "content": "\"That's What I Came For\"I loved +Dale Dougherty's insights into what makes him a sports fan, from his recent travelogue about his visit to the Sochi Winter Olympics. (The whole piece is long, but has many great moments. https://medium.com/p/e83510811c37):\"It\u2019s hard to watch the Olympics on TV in America because of the way they package it for Americans, trying to develop a sense that we are rooting for our country and making a connection to American athletes. So much is fabricated, and I wanted to see beyond that. I didn\u2019t come to root for TeamUSA, although I do care what Americans are doing and how American athletes are competing. But it is not why I came to Sochi.\"What I found special occurred surprisingly not at any of the events we went to, which included ski jumping, ice hockey and ice dancing, but took place two different times before a big screen TV inside the Adler transportation hub. We had just gotten off the train and there was a crowd of people looking up at the TV. All of them had stopped. The Russians were playing the US in curling, and the Americans had their last turn in a tie contest, as the stone went across the ice. It wasn\u2019t clear who won until one member of the Russian team raised his hands in celebration. Another day, the US was playing against Russia in hockey, and in the third period, the Russians scored a goal to tie the game. Both times, the crowd erupted in cheers, and a swelling of emotion that led to chanting \u201cRUS-SI-YA\u201d, \u201cRUS-SI-YA.\u201dhttp://youtu.be/zLvEtT2HcZM\"Something extraordinary was happening, and I realized that I shared their emotion, not because I rooted for the same team or same country, but I could ride the lifting emotion and energy, and its sudden appearance was something we all could enjoy. That was it, I thought at the time. That\u2019s what I came for.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "\"This was an Olympics by and for the Russians.\"From +Dale Dougherty's travelogue on the Sochi Olympics:\"On our first night, we didn\u2019t see the crowds that came later in the week. The most obvious thing was not just that there were few Americans in the crowd, but few Europeans as well. The crowd was predominantly Russian tourists. This was an Olympics by and for the Russians. There was very little international character to the event....\"Russia was on the stage, front and center, and even backstage. It was seen inside Russia as a triumph for Putin and the return of Russia to world prominence. It was also colorfully packaged as building the Russian brand for millions in a television audience watching from Europe and the US. Yet, as one American who had been to the Olympics in Vancouver said to me: \u201cThis is a somber Olympics.\u201d It was not a party for anyone but the Russians themselves, and they came from remote regions to get their pictures taken here, holding their own flag. Perhaps for them, like us, Sochi was a version of Russia that they had not seen before.\"Fascinating!\ufeff",

   "content": "Urban Office-steading in BrooklynOn Monday, I visited O'Reilly Media's small development office in Brooklyn, where Rune Madsen, Zach Schwartz, and Steve Klise\u00a0are working on our Atlas publishing tools (e.g.\u00a0http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/). \u00a0They are holed up on the sixth floor of the old Pfizer Building on Flushing Avenue, with a spectacular view of the NY skyline.But what is most fun about the building is the way it is being developed. Rather than being a polished office building all ready for new tenants, it is being developed piecemeal in an exciting kind of urban reconstruction. After I had a look at the small office, we went on a tour of the vast undeveloped regions of the sixth floor, where rooms with mysterious purposes still remain, in skeletal form. \u00a0(Apparently, this was the area used to film the Green Goblin's lair in one of the Spider Man movies.) \u00a0In some areas, there are cinder block walls with holes knocked in them. \u00a0(Sadly, I somehow missed pictures of these.)Up on the eighth floor are a cluster of small food startups - pickles, bakeries, juice companies. \u00a0They apparently make the building a delight, because they sell lunch on many days.\u00a0It struck me that this is a very different kind of redevelopment than I've seen in San Francisco. \u00a0Grittier, more frontier.I love it!\ufeff",

   "content": "I am somewhat appalled by the sloppy thinking of many of the Internet's latter-day critics. For example, in Joe Nocera's glowing review of Jaron Lanier's book, Who Owns The Future, I read:\"There are two additional components to Lanier\u2019s thesis.\u00a0The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \u201cjust one form of network efficiency.\u201d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier 'Kodak employed more than 140,000 people.' Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: 'When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.'\u201dThink about it for a minute. Was it really Instagram that replaced Kodak? Wasn't it actually Apple, Samsung, and the other smartphone makers who have replaced the camera? \u00a0And aren't there network providers, data centers, and equipment suppliers who provide the replacement for the film that Kodak once sold? Apple has 72,000 employees ( up from 10,000 in 2002. http://bit.ly/1lEY8HG). Samsung has 270,000 employees. \u00a0Comcast has 126,000. And so on.Of course, there was a much larger ecosystem of people making money from photography in the Kodak era than those who worked for Kodak directly, but so too, the digital ecosystem is far larger than Lanier's silly example suggests. An economic ecosystem is a lot like an iceberg. Most of it is underwater. And shallow pronouncements like the one above do us all a disservice.I do agree with Jaron Lanier's key point, as reported by Nocera:\u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d\u00a0I agree with that point - and have repeatedly warned about the risks. See for example, my 2007 observations about lessons from Wall Street for internet companies, Trading for Their Own Account (http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html), and my repeated urgings for companies to create more value than they capture (http://bit.ly/1lF0d6y). \u00a0But I don't actually believe that internet companies are hollowing out the economy, and I do believe that many of them do think about enriching their customers. \u00a0See for example Hal Varian's analysis of the economic impact of Google advertising (http://www.google.com/economicimpact/) or my own analysis of the economic impact of the web hosting market on small business (http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/open-source-small-business-report.html).Contrast this with the damage to the economy done by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have truly worked to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers and the public, and the Internet gets a pretty good grade.The full story of the economic impact of digital networks has yet to unfold, let alone to be understood. \u00a0There is an awful lot of blind internet boosterism, but the latest round of critics seem even more wilfully blind than those they lambaste. For more nuanced, thoughtful reading on the impact of the internet, Nocera would do better to read books like +Ethan Zuckerman's _ Rewire_ (http://www.amazon.com/Rewire-Digital-Cosmopolitans-Age-Connection/dp/0393082830) or Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolffsson's Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age (http://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies-ebook/dp/B00D97HPQI/).\ufeff",
